          <div class="main-project-first-text-desc">
            In our lives we encounter many situations where we are in a group
            and we have to make a decision out of some points. To select 1 or 2
            points among many given choices is a difficult task when you are a
            group. One of the best way to do so is <b>“Polling”.</b> <br />
            <br />

            We encounter such polls in our general day to day life, whether to
            decide picnic spot or planning meeting etc. So, if we can integrate
            this method in one of our daily routine applications this can ease
            out things at a very basic level. <br />
            <br />

            So, for such purpose the best possible idea is to integrate it with
            “WhatsApp”. As the
            <b>population using WhatsApp is 1.5 Billion as of December 2017</b>
            and out of them
            <b>58% are using several times on a daily basis.</b> The platform
            this big would be affecting a huge user base so the utility of
            polling feature can be huge. <br />

            aspect of the topic is covered. <br />
            3. Defining issues or problems in the feature to be solved before
            integrating with the app. <br />
            4. Finalizing the features to be given in the polling option. <br />
            5. Making sketches and wireframes for the solution suggested. <br />
            6. Integrating the feature with the parent app. <br />

            Define Target Audience
          </div>
          <div class="main-project-first-text-desc">
            I defined the sections of the users involved in WhatsApp. <br />
            1. Students <br />
            2. Professional/Office workers <br />
            3. Secretary or leader of a group <br />
            4. Housewives <br />
            <br />

            These sections represent most of the user base. But there are some
            <b
              >edge case user base. <br />
              5. Political Groups <br />
              6. Anti-Nationalist Groups <br />
              7. Terrorist Groups <br />
              <br />
            </b>

            We cannot neglect these type of users, these new facilities may be
            useful for them too, which in return can be
            <b>harmful for the society.</b> <br />
            <br />

            So, I developed the case that new and efficient features are very
            good to be included but those should also be made to add value to
            the society. <br />
            <br />

            And, the recent addition to the community is: <br />
            <b>8. Businesses</b> (like MakeMyTrip & BookMyShow) <br />
            Which uses WhatsApp as a medium for promotion as well as service
            providing.

            Started by Heuristic Approach and thought of points I should
            consider to be involved in the feature. After giving this a thought
            I came up with certain points <br />
            <br />

            a). Who will have the authority to create a poll? <br />
            b). Can a I select multiple options? <br />
            c). Can I change my response once selected? <br />
            d). Should my response be visible to other members of the group?
            <br />
            e). How long will the poll last? <br />
            f). Should there be real time track of results or they should be
            posted at last? <br />
            g). What about notifying me about the opening and ending of poll?
            <br />
            h). Previous poll summary? <br />

            All these points gave the initial idea to approach towards the
            solution.

            User Analysis : Qualitative approach
          </div>
          <div class="main-project-first-text-desc">
            Thinking of the user base of WhatsApp which is around 1.5 Billion
            and also time constraints of the research, user research methodology
            can change in a lot different manner. The user research in
            “Quantitative Analysis” would be very less effective as in such
            short spam diversified analysis would not be possible. We could be
            analysing only a small diversity of users and reporting results for
            them only, which would a very bad practice. <br />
            <br />

            So, I took <b>“Qualitative Approach”</b> in my user study and
            targeted 1 or 2 users which can represent their type of people in
            diversity.
            <b
              >Point to be noted here is that the user here is a group of people
              not a single person.</b
            >
            So personas should be made for group only, and the person selected
            should be well enough to represent a group. <br /><br />

            Based on my initial defined questions
            <b>I created a questionnaire</b> which allowed me to interact with
            the group representative and to integrate his/her valuable points in
            the feature.

          Now <b>I started discussion with all of these users</b> and tried to

          Inference : Feature Deciding
        </div>
        <div class="main-project-first-text-desc">
          1. Mainly the user base is having around <b>10 groups</b> in which
          <b>90% of them are informal types</b>.<br /><br />
          2. People mostly don't actively take part in all the groups but do
          involve when a excitement factor is there or they are being mentioned.
          <br /><br />
          3. <b>Polls will be very small scale</b> and involvement of people can
          be increased by small attention.<br /><br />
          4. <b>Mostly user have used polls</b> because they use facebook
          also<br /><br />
          5. <b>Anyone can create a poll</b>, everyone is important in a
          group.<br /><br />
          6. <b>Mostly informal topics</b> to be discussed over<br /><br />
          7. Looking to all points there should be a
          <b>feature to decide the type of group</b> it is. That is business,
          family, etc. so that in formal groups we should not give changing
          option as there decisions should be taken by taking time and thinking
          more so option should be chosen once. But in general case of informal
          groups changing views is a human tendency and it should be there in
          feature.<br /><br />
          8. At last motive of the poll was to take out result only so
          <b>results should be shown</b> at last but only manually written
          because sometimes inference is not that direct.<br /><br />
          9. The
          <b
            >faces of people should not be seen upfront but after a click who
            has voted</b
          >
          should be there. This will decrease the chances of influence. But if
          anyone wants to see he/she can click. Also it can encourage other
          people to vote in the poll, which is a good option.<br /><br />
          10. Views of the members of the group matters a lot and thus
          <b
            >adding option should be given with a check or moderation that
            admin/creator can delete the response added if not valuable</b
          >. But still only max of 15 poll options will be there not more than
          that. Otherwise very much confusion.<br /><br />
          11. Generally time needed for most of the use cases are 4-5 hrs max.
          so we can put <b>4 hrs limit to the poll feature</b>, which will
          include maximum of the users.
          <b>But the admin or poll creator can lock the poll votes</b> if they
          think so.<br /><br />
          12. It should contain <b>notification of poll to remind people</b>.
          Also <b>poll could be answered from notification panel in mobile</b>,
          to ease the experience.<br /><br />
          13. The use of camera feature is very rare but the use of poll would
          be even more rare so showing upfront would not be useful. In the
          attach column the
          <b>payment icon can be replaced by poll (only in group chat)</b> as no
          one pays to the group hence no use of it there.<br /><br />
          14. There should be a <b>feature to see the previous polls</b> of the
          group.

          Special Cases, thoughts and features

        <br />
        <div class="main-project-first-text-desc">
          Going through all the features and user studies, I came across many
          different type of cases which would not be discussed in general study
          of user.<br /><br />
          The Edge case users include<br /><br />
          <b>1. Businesses</b><br /><br />
          Some businesses like Make My Trip and Bookmyshow use whatsapp for the
          promotional and service providing purposes. They may need poll option
          to take survey from the users. <br /><br />
          In those cases the time limit for the survey should be a feature where
          they can expand their time. This type of feature may be a paid version
          in <b>“WhatsApp Business”</b> app.<br /><br />
          <b>2. Anti-Terrorism and Anti-nationalist</b><br /><br />
          These type of people may use whatsapp polling feature to harm the
          society. Like they may create poll in their groups : Which leader to
          kill or which city to attack? Such cases must be seen and solved.<br /><br />
          The solution I can propose is using Artificial Intelligence to
          understand such critical statements and do not let them post such
          stuff on their groups.<br /><br />
          <b>3. Cases involving polling for serious issues like Suicide</b
          ><br /><br />
          There may be cases where people may post dark things like how to
          commit suicide or how to become thief and all such things which are
          again harmful for the society.<br /><br />
          Again the solution is AI. Which can respond to the user in positive
          manner and try to help them in some way just like google search do
          when someone types <b>“I want to suicide”</b>.<br /><br />

          The discussed last 2 things are some of the very less thought edge
          cases which can be very helpful in improving the society to a large
          extent as the user base is very large.<br /><br />

          Facebook’s User Behaviour data can be useful to the whatsapp to build
          the AI needed in this feature. <br /><br />

          With AI we can eliminate many points that are some pain ponts:<br /><br />

          1. Options added should not be similar to previous ones.<br />
          2. With improved learning AI can suggest the type of options poll
          should have just like google forms have. <br />
          3. Above discussed social issues.<br /><br />

          There are some drawbacks of AI<br /><br />

          1. It is very hectic work to integrate with the whatsapp as due to end
          to end encryption it will not be on online web but on the device
          itself which is very tough task.<br />
          2. Whatsapp comes in 60 languages and to evolve AI to that extent is
          very tough task too.<br />
          3. People may try to use content in such way that it is not clearly
          understandable to software but that is harmful for the people.<br /><br />

          <div class="main-project-first-text-heading">Summarizing</div>
          <br />
          <div class="main-project-first-text-desc">
            The WhatsApp polling feature is a very unique and effective idea for
            most of the sections of the users. Long chats and vague polls can be
            sorted in a nice way. But there are some disadvantages also that can
            be minimized by using adequate technologies.<br /><br />
            These type of polling are there in many of the places but the check
            on these surveys are not there. The advancement in technologies and
            educating the user is the best way to overcome such points.
            Sometimes it's not only about earning money or giving ease of
            experience to the users, but also adding value to the society.
